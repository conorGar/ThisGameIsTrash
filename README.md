This Game Is Trash is a large scale action adventure game with a hand-sculpted claymation artstyle.

I always loved the idea of a time limit in games like Pikmin, and always felt like there was a lot of untapped potential with it. The idea is every day the player makes a choice: "Do I wanna spend my time collecting trash? But there's this ice cream scoop that's gonna die in 3 days and wants to spend time with me... But DJ Krabby Krab has this concert he wants me to go to..."etc
